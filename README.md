# Plant Disease Detector

- Used Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and NumPy
- Trained over multiple datasets
- can identify different types of plant diseases
- Deployed as a web application : upload images of plant leaves and the model will predict the type of disease.

## Tech Stack

- TensorFlow: to train and build deep learning model.
- NumPy: python library
- Flask: deploying plant leaf disease detection model as a web application
- Python: building the model and the web application
- Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
